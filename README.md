## Tentative Plan
- [ ] Search for 200-250 images for each class
- [ ] Crop square images
- [ ] Make initial model - aim for 75% accuracy on test data
- [ ] Build pipeline for incoming images - bounding box -> crop -> resize -> predict
- [ ] Deploy model (preferably on Heroku - can also try other platforms)
- [ ] Search for more images - aim for 500 per class
- [ ] Modify model for 85% accuracy on test data
- [ ] Data Augmentation
- [ ] Retrain model - aim for 90% accuracy on test data
