## Tentative Plan
- [] June Week 1: Images, Image Metadata, Relevance, Summary statistics, Scraped from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Datasets
- [] June Week 2: Labelled data for training and testing. [Data in the proper format, ready to be used for the model]
- [] July Week 2: Prototyped Machine Learning Model 
- [] July Week 3: Test run for the Model using training data
- [] July Week 4: Validation of Model 
- [] August Week 1: Final training of Reworked Model
- [] August Week 2: Final validation of Reworked Model
- [] September Week 2: Demonstration of the Model

- - [ ] Search for 200-250 images for each class
- - [ ] Crop square images
- - [ ] Make initial model - aim for 75% accuracy on test data
- - [ ] Build pipeline for incoming images - bounding box -> crop -> resize -> predict
- - [ ] Deploy model (preferably on Heroku - can also try other platforms)
- - [ ] Search for more images - aim for 500 per class
- - [ ] Modify model for 85% accuracy on test data
- - [ ] Data Augmentation
- - [ ] Retrain model - aim for 90% accuracy on test data
