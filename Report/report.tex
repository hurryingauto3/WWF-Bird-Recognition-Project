\subsection{Project Description}
\setlength{\parindent}{3em}
% An introduction of the project, no more than 2 sentences. Provide the highest level of detail only. Other details will come later.
% Typically, "This project is to <short description of porject> for/at <client>."
This project is aimed at creating and deploying a deep learning pipeline for WWF Pakistan to classify images of 
three different species of birds; namely: common myna, house crow, and the house sparrow. This project 
would serve as a proof-of-concept for a larger model that WWF can use to classify a larger number of birds 
using a mobile application.

\subsection{About WWF Pakistan}
The World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF) is an international non-governmental organization
founded in 1961 that primarily works in the areas of wildlife conservation and preservation.
WWF also works in the domains of food security, renewable energy, ocean and forest preservation, 
and many others\footnote{\url{https://wwf.panda.org/}}.

WWF Pakistan is the Pakistan chapter of the World Wildlife Fund, working on similar problems as 
WWF International but in a more local context. WWF has more than five regional offices 
throughout the country, and has conducted several successful 
projects pertaining to freshwater conservation, water security, forests, climate change and others.
What they are most known for, however, is wildlife conservation --- the area that we 
have assisted WWF in.

\subsection{Project Background \& Context}
Keeping track of biodiversity is a challenge in Pakistan due to a lack of resources, personnel 
and governmental support. Pakistan has a plethora of wildlife and a rich and diverse ecosystem. 
WWF Pakistan has helped in the conservation of several endangered species such as the 
Indus River Dolphin and the Snow Leopard --- both of which are now experiencing a rise in numbers. 

However, wildlife preservation and protection extends beyond just the conservation of 
endangered species. Maintaining biodiversity is extremely important for 
wildlife protection and to maintain a healhty ecosystem and environment. Unfortunately, 
a lack of biodiversity is a major crisis that is unfolding across the globe. In order to 
combat this, it is imperative that researches have updated data about species populations, 
habitats, interactions etc. 

An important group of animals that contribute to biodiversity are birds. Therefore, 
it is vital that data pertaining to bird population is collected in Pakistan. 
To assist in this endeavor, WWF aims to enlist the help of citizen scientists who could 
help identify and locate birds and consequently update WWF's database. 

Our project aims to implement a deep learning pipeline that would 
classify images of three different species of birds --- house crow, common 
myna, and the house sparrow. The pipeline would take an image, preprocess it 
to a form that the model can work with, and then classify it using a deep 
neural network --- telling us what species the bird in the image belongs to. 

This pipeline serves as a proof-of-concept for a larger model that 
would be classifying hundreds of species of birds. This model will fit 
into a planned mobile application that citizen scientists can use to spot birds 
and then capture their image. Not only will the application classify the 
species of the bird but it will also update WWF's database, giving them 
access to more data about bird populations and their locations. 

The development of a larger deep learning model and an application is 
beyond the scope of our \textit{Khidmat} due to time restraints. 
We have succesfully implemented a computer vision pipeline for preprocessing 
and a deep neural network for classification for three species of birds.

\section{Technical Overview}
\subsection{Resources}
  The resources that we used for this project can be categorized into two main 
  categories: images, and technologies. Our first step was to acquire a set of images that would 
  function as our dataset. We collected around 550 images for each of the three 
  species of birds --- the house crow, common myna, and the house sparrow. We used 
  several different websites and online databases to find these images, we list 
  these websites below: 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \url{https://search.macaulaylibrary.org/catalog?taxonCode=myna&mediaType=p&q=Common\%20Myna}
    \item \url{https://ebird.org/media/catalog?taxonCode=commyn&mediaType=p&sort=rating_rank_desc&q=Common\%20Myna\%20-\%20Acridotheres\%20tristis}
    \item \url{https://ebird.org/media/catalog?taxonCode=houcro1&sort=rating_rank_desc&mediaType=p&regionCode=}
    \item \url{https://search.macaulaylibrary.org/catalog?taxonCode=houcro1&mediaType=p&region=Pakistan\%20(PK)&regionCode=PK&q=House\%20Crow\%20-\%20Corvus\%20splendens}
    \item \url{https://www.kaggle.com/gpiosenka/100-bird-species}
    \item \url{https://search.macaulaylibrary.org/catalog?taxonCode=houspa&mediaType=p&q=House\%20Sparrow}
    \item \url{https://ebird.org/media/catalog?taxonCode=houspa&mediaType=p&sort=rating_rank_desc&q=House\%20Sparrow\%20-\%20Passer\%20domesticus}
    \label{imagelinks}
  \end{enumerate}

  All collected images can be viewed at \url{https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18k-roE_VJSB1dcrhvN1y_EosVF7Kb0dY?usp=sharing}.

  To preprocess our images, convert them into a usable dataset, and to create
  our deep learning model, we had to rely on several different preexisting tools.
  We list the tools that we used in this project below:
  \setlength{\parskip}{0em}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Python} --- The primary programming language that we used for this project.
      Most of the other tools that we used are different libraries \& modules for in Python.
    \item \texttt{OpenCV} --- A computer vision module in Python to preprocess the images. 
    \item \texttt{TensorFlow \& Keras} --- A Python library that we used to construct, and then 
      ttrain and test our neural network. 
    \item \texttt{Matplotlib} --- A plotting library for Python, which we used to visualize our
    \item \texttt{Sci-kit learn} --- A Python library for machine learning that we used to 
      construct our training and testing set. 
    \item \texttt{Google Colab} --- We used Colab notebooks to write code and then run code
      using GPU-accelerated computation that is made available using Google Colaboratory.
  \end{itemize}
 
\subsection{Overview of CS Techniques Used}
  This project was an amalgamation of several different aspects of computer science techniques.
  The process can be summarized into 5 main steps:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Image Collection
    \item Image Preprocessing 
    \item Construction of Neural Network 
    \item Training the Neural Network
    \item Testing and Optimization
  \end{enumerate}
  
  We briefly expand upon these steps in the following sections. For a more technical 
  description, please view the documentation (LINK HERE). 

  \subsubsection{Image Collection}
  We used the sources listed at~\ref{imagelinks} to collect images of the three species of birds.
  We downloaded approximately 650 images for each birds, which we then filtered
  down to around 550 to maintain uniform image quality. Based on our results, we believe
  the number of images that we have, i.e. the size of our dataset is adequate. 
  
  \subsubsection{Image Preprocessing}
  The next step was to pre-process these images to convert them into a
  usable dataset. 

  % TODO: - write this part: make it slightly detailed but easy to understand 
  %       - include technical details in addendum
